# VideoMind frontend

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

## Output directory

- Build output: `dist`

## Required public environment variable

Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and set:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-public-api-domain.example
```

This value must be a public, non-secret base URL. Do not place backend credentials or private keys in VITE_ variables.

## Required backend endpoint

The early-access form expects a public backend route:

```http
POST /api/early-access
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "consent": true
}
```

The backend must return JSON in the form:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "string"
}
```

or an error response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "string"
}
```

Until that endpoint is implemented, the UI remains in a safe non-submission state and shows a clear unavailable message instead of pretending the form succeeded.

## Deployment notes

- Domain: `https://videomind.in/`
- HTTPS is required for production usage.
- Ensure the Vite build output is served from the configured web host and that SPA fallback is enabled for routes such as `/privacy-policy`.
- Verify the favicon and the social preview image load correctly in production.
- Test the live site in an incognito browser session to confirm the route, metadata, and form state behave as expected.

## Verification checklist

- Confirm `/privacy-policy` loads correctly.
- Confirm `/og-image.svg` loads and the social preview renders properly.
- Confirm the favicon loads without 404s.
- Confirm the early-access form does not silently store submissions in browser localStorage for production.
- Confirm the site works correctly over HTTPS.
